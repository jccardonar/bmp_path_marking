                 BMP Extension for Path Status sub-TLV
                draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-marking-tlv-05

Abstract

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining
   BGP Path information.  BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP
   Route Monitoring (RM) messages.  This document proposes an extension
   to BMP to convey the status of a BGP path before and after being
   processed by the BGP best-path selection algorithm.  This extension
   makes use of the Path Information TLV defined in [draft-cppy-grow-
   bmp-path-info-tlv].

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC 2119 [RFC2119] RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they

1.  Introduction

   For a given prefix, multiple paths with different path status, e.g.,
   the "best-path", "back-up path" and so on, may co-exist in the BGP
   RIB after being processed by the local policy and the BGP decision
   process.  The path status information is currently not carried in the
   BGP Update Message RFC4271 [RFC4271] or in the BMP Update Message
   RFC7854 [RFC7854].

   External systems can use the path status for various applications.
   The path status is commonly checked by operators when performing
   troubleshooting.  Having such status stored in a centralized system
   can enable the development of tools that facilitate this process.
   Optimisation systems can include the path status in their process,
   and also use the status as a validation source (since it can compare
   the calculated state to the actual outcome of the network, such as
   primary and backup path).  As a final example, path status
   information can complement other centralized sources of data, for
   example, flow collectors.

Internet-Draft           BMP path status sub-tlv               July 2020


   This document defines a so-called Path Status sub-TLV to convey the
   BGP path status to the BMP server.  The BMP Path Status sub-TLV is
   encapsulated within the BMP Path Information TLV carried in the BMP
   Route Monitoring (RM) Message [draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-info-tlv].

2.  Path Status sub-TLV

   As stated in [draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-info-tlv], the order of the
   sub-TLVs MUST be in accordance with the prefix order encapsulated in
   the Update PDU.  This document defines two types of Path Status sub-
   TLVs: one is IANA-registered Path Status sub-TLV, and the other is
   Enterprise-specific Path Status sub-TLV.

2.1.  IANA-registered Path Status sub-TLV

      0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1

     +---------------------------------------------------------------+

         Figure 2:IANA-Registered Encoding of path status sub-TLV

   o  E bit: For an IANA-registered sub-TLV, the E bit MUST be set to 0.

   o  Type = TBD2 (31 Bits): indicates that it's the IANA-registered
      Path Status sub-TLV.

   o  Length (2 Octets): indicates the length of the value field of the
      Path Status TLV.  The value field further consists of the Path-
      Status field and Reason Code field.

   o  Path Status (4 Octets): indicates the path status of the BGP
      Update PDU encapsulated in the RM Message.  Currently 9 types of
      path status are defined, as shown in Table 1.

   o  Reason Code (4 Octets): indicates the reasons/explanations of the
      path status indicated in the Path Type field.  The currently
      defined reason codes are shown in Table 2.

                    +------------+------------------+

                    Table 1: IANA-Registered Path Type

   The Path Status field contains a bitmap where each bit encodes a
   specific role of the path.  Multiple bits may be set when multiple
   path status apply to a path.

   o  The best-path is defined in RFC4271 [RFC4271] and the best-
      external path is defined in draft-ietf-idr-best-external
      [I-D.ietf-idr-best-external].

   o  An invalid path is a route that does not enter the BGP decision
      process.

   o  A non-selected path is a route that is not selected in the BGP
      decision process.  Back-up routes are considered non-selected,
      while the best and ECMP routes are not considered as non-selected.

   o  A primary path is a recursive or non-recursive path whose nexthop
      resolution ends with an adjacency draft-ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic
      [I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic].  A prefix can have more than one primary
      path if multipath is configured draft-lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-
      considerations [I-D.lapukhov-bgp-ecmp-considerations].  A best-
      path is also considered as a primary path.

   o  A backup path is also installed in the RIB, but it is not used
      until some or all primary paths become unreachable.  Backup paths
      are used for fast convergence in the event of failures.

   o  A non-installed path refers to the route that is not installed
      into the IP routing table.

   o  For the advertisement of multiple paths for the same address
      prefix without the new paths implicitly replacing any previous
      ones, the add-path status is applied RFC7911 [RFC7911].

2.2.  Enterprise-specific Path Status sub-TLV

   of vendor-specific TLVs in addition to IANA-registered one.  In this
   document, both encoding options for the Path Status sub-TLV are
   described.
