    <abstract>
      <t>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining
      BGP Path information. BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP Route
      Monitoring (RM) messages. This document proposes an extension to BMP to
      convey the status of a path after being processed by the BGP process. 
      This extension makes use of the TLV mechanims described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv">draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv</xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit">draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit</xref>.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>For a given prefix, multiple paths with different path status, e.g.,
      the "best-path", "back-up path", "invalid", and so on, may co-exist in
      the BGP RIBs after being processed by the BGP decision process.
      The path status information is currently not carried in the BGP Update
      Message <xref target="RFC4271">RFC4271</xref> or in the BMP Update
      Message <xref target="RFC7854">RFC7854</xref>.</t>

      <t>External systems can use the path status for various applications.
      The path status is commonly checked by operators when performing
      troubleshooting. Having such status stored in a centralized system can
      enable the development of tools that facilitate this process.
      Optimisation systems can include the path status in their process, and
      also use the status as a validation source (since it can compare the
      calculated state to the actual outcome of the network, such as primary
      and backup path). As a final example, path status information can
      complement other centralized sources of data, for example, flow
      collectors.</t>

      <t>This document defines a so-called Path Status TLV to convey the BGP
      path status to the BMP server. The BMP Path Status TLV is carried in the
      BMP Route Monitoring (RM) Message.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Path Status TLV">
      <t>This document defines two types of Path Status TLVs: one is the
      IANA-registered Path Status TLV, and the other is the
      Enterprise-specific Path Status TLV.</t>

          </figure>The Path Status field contains a bitmap where each bit
              encodes a specific role of the path. Multiple bits may be set

        <t><list style="symbols">

            <t>An invalid path is a route that does not enter the BGP decision

            <t>A non-selected path is a route that is not selected in the BGP
            decision process. Back-up routes are considered non-selected,
            while the best and ECMP routes are not considered as
            non-selected.</t>

            <t>A primary path is a recursive or non-recursive path whose
            nexthop resolution ends with an adjacency <xref
            target="I-D.ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic">draft-ietf-rtgwg-bgp-pic</xref>. A

            <t>A backup path is also installed in the RIB, but it is not used
            until some or all primary paths become unreachable. Backup paths
            are used for fast convergence in the event of failures.</t>

            <t>A non-installed path refers to the route that is not installed
            into the IP routing table.</t>

            <t>For the advertisement of multiple paths for the same address
            prefix without the new paths implicitly replacing any previous
            ones, the add-path status is applied <xref target="RFC7911"/>.</t>

          </list>

          The path status TLV does not force a BMP client to send any of
              these paths. It just provides a method to mark the paths that are
              available with their status.

    <section title="Implementation notes">

        <t>The BMP path marking TLV remains optional within BMP
            implementations.</t>

        <t>An implementation of the BMP path marking TLV may not fully support
        marking of all status defined in table <xref target="status_codes"/> or
        any future extensions. Similarly, an implementation may choose to
        support the inclusion of the reason code (for which support is also
        optional), without necessarily incorporating any of the reason codes
            defined in table <xref target="reasons_codes"/> or future
                extensions.</t>

        <t>This document refrains from defining mechanisms for signaling the
            status or reason codes an implementation supports. This could be
            established through external means (e.g. documentation) or
            potentially addressed in a subsequent document.</t>

        <t>The remainder of this section encompasses additional points related
            to the implementation of the BMP Path marking TLV.</t>

        <section title="Configuration of BMP path marking">

            <t>Implementations supporting the BMP path marking TLV SHOULD
                provide an option for enabling or disabling the Path Marking
                TLV over BMP sessions. Furthermore,  the configuration options
                for this TLV SHOULD provide the means to enable and disable the
                transmission of reason codes, if the reason code are supported by the
                implementation.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Paths with no markings">

            <t>Some BGP routes might not require any type of status or reasons.
            For example, an unfiltered path obtained via the Adj-RIB-IN may
            fall under this category since there is really nothing to mark for
            that path.  We suggest a couple of approaches for signaling
            that a path has no markings: (1) An implicit form of marking,
            achieved by abstaining from appending any BMP marking TLV pointing
            toward the route. (2) Alternatively, an explicit marking of the
            packet through a TLV containing no marked status and no associated
            reason code.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Significance of status and origin RIBs">

            <t>This document refrains from imposing any implementation to mark
            specific status from specific RIBs. We recognize the diversity
            among implementations;  some might be able to mark some status over
            one RIB while other do it on others. For instance, some might be
            able to mark Adj-RIB-in filtered routes when obtained from the
            Adj-RIB-IN pre, while other could do it only from the Adj-RIB-IN
            post. To remove ambiguities in implementations, we recommend the
                meaning of status (and reason codes) to not depend on the
                origin RIB of a route.</t>

        </section>

        <section title="Enterprise-specific status and reasons" anchor="ebit_mixed">

            <t>Implementations introducing their own status and reason codes
            are advised to adhere to <xref

                specific status and reasons. Additionally, we recommend all
                implementations to provide comprehensive documentation for
                these codes.</t>

            <t>For scenarios where a path state combines a standard status with
                an enterprise-specific reason code (or vice versa), the

                    direct marking within the same packet using the ebit.</li> 
                <li>Assigning two TLVs to the same path(s): one containing the standard
                    part and another housing the vendor-specific part.</li>

        <section title="Multiple TLVs assigned to the same route.">

            <t>We advocate for the employment of TLV grouping wherever
                feasible. The inclusion of all marking information within a
                single message is recommended, except on the case described in
                section <xref target="ebit_mixed"/>. In situations where
                    multiple TLVs are associated with a single route, all
                    markings will be applicable to that route.</t>
