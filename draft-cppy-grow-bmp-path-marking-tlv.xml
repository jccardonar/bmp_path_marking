    <abstract>
      <t>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining
      BGP Path information. BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP Route
      Monitoring (RM) messages. This document proposes an extension to BMP to
      convey the status of a BGP path before and after being processed by the
      BGP best-path selection algorithm. This extension makes use of the Path
      Information TLV defined in [draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-info-tlv].</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>For a given prefix, multiple paths with different path status, e.g.,
      the "best-path", "back-up path" and so on, may co-exist in the BGP RIB
      after being processed by the local policy and the BGP decision process.
      The path status information is currently not carried in the BGP Update
      Message <xref target="RFC4271">RFC4271</xref> or in the BMP Update
      Message <xref target="RFC7854">RFC7854</xref>.</t>

      <t>External systems can use the path status for various applications.
      The path status is commonly checked by operators when performing
      troubleshooting. Having such status stored in a centralized system can
      enable the development of tools that facilitate this process. Optimisation
      systems can include the path status in their process, and also use the
      status as a validation source (since it can compare the calculated state
      to the actual outcome of the network, such as primary and backup path).
      As a final example, path status information can complement other
      centralized sources of data, for example, flow collectors.</t>

      <t>This document defines a so-called Path Status sub-TLV to convey the
      BGP path status to the BMP server. The BMP Path Status sub-TLV is
      encapsulated within the BMP Path Information TLV carried in the BMP
      Route Monitoring (RM) Message [draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-info-tlv].</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Path Status sub-TLV">
      <t>As stated in [draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-info-tlv], the order of the
      sub-TLVs MUST be in accordance with the prefix order encapsulated in the
      Update PDU. 
      This document defines two types of Path Status sub-TLVs: one is
      IANA-registered Path Status sub-TLV, and the other is
      Enterprise-specific Path Status sub-TLV.</t>
