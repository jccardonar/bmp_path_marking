    <abstract>
      <t>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining
      BGP Path information. BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP Route
      Monitoring (RM) messages. This document proposes an extension to BMP to
      convey the status of a BGP path before and after being processed by the
      BGP best-path selection algorithm. This extension makes use of the TLV
      mechanims described in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-tlv">draft-ietf-grow-bmp-tlv</xref> and <xref
      target="I-D.lucente-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit">draft-lucente-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit</xref>.

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>For a given prefix, multiple paths with different path status, e.g.,
      the "best-path", "back-up path" and so on, may co-exist in the BGP RIB
      after being processed by the local policy and the BGP decision process.
      The path status information is currently not carried in the BGP Update
      Message <xref target="RFC4271">RFC4271</xref> or in the BMP Update
      Message <xref target="RFC7854">RFC7854</xref>.</t>

      <t>External systems can use the path status for various applications.
      The path status is commonly checked by operators when performing
      troubleshooting. Having such status stored in a centralized system can
      enable the development of tools that facilitate this process.
      Optimisation systems can include the path status in their process, and
      also use the status as a validation source (since it can compare the
      calculated state to the actual outcome of the network, such as primary
      and backup path). As a final example, path status information can
      complement other centralized sources of data, for example, flow
      collectors.</t>

      <t>This document defines a so-called Path Status TLV to convey the BGP
      path status to the BMP server. The BMP Path Status TLV is carried in the
      BMP Route Monitoring (RM) Message.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Path Status TLV">
      <t>This document defines two types of Path Status TLVs: one is the
      IANA-registered Path Status TLV, and the other is the
      Enterprise-specific Path Status TLV.</t>
