                 BMP Extension for Path Information TLV
                  draft-cppy-grow-bmp-path-info-tlv-00

Abstract

   The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining
   BGP path information.  BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP
   Route Monitoring (RM) messages.  This document proposes an extension
   to BMP to convey additional path information that is not already
   encapsulated in the BGP Update PDU, e.g., BPG path status.  This
   extension makes use of the TLV mechanims described in draft-grow-bmp-
   tlv [I-D.grow-bmp-tlv].

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 RFC 2119 [RFC2119] RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they
   appear in all capitals, as shown here.

1.  Introduction

   BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) RFC7854 [RFC7854] is used to monitor
   BGP sessions.  Additional information is allowed to be carried in the
   format of TLV with the BMP Initiation, Peer Up, and Termination
   Messages RFC7854 [RFC7854] draft-ietf-grow-bmp-peer-up
   [I-D.ietf-grow-bmp-peer-up].  draft-grow-bmp-tlv [I-D.grow-bmp-tlv]
   provides the capability of conveying optional data in TLV format in
   BMP Route Monitoring (RM) and Peer Down Messages, and such TLV types
   are to be defined for each application.  This document defines the
   Path Information TLV, making use of the TLV mechanism defined for BMP
   RM Message draft-grow-bmp-tlv [I-D.grow-bmp-tlv].  The Path
   Information TLV is used to describe the path information, e.g., path
   status (best, best-external), out interface, and so on.  Specific
   path information can be defined as sub-TLVs encapsulated within the
   Path Information TLV.

2.  Path Information TLV for the RM Message

   The Path Information TLV is defined as follows.

                   Figure 1: Path Information TLV

   o  Type = TBD1 (2 Octets): indicates that it's the Path Information
      TLV.

   o  Length (2 Octets): indicates the length of the value field of the
      Path Information TLV.

   o  Count (2 Octets): indicates the number of sub TLVs followed in the
      Path Information Value field.

   o  Path Information value (Variable): indicates the value of the Path
      Informtion TLV, which consists of one or multiple sub TLVs.

   Each RM Message allows at most one Path Information TLV.  As stated
   in Appendix F.1 of RFC4271 [RFC4271], multiple address prefixes
   (i.e., NLRI) with the same path attributes are allowed to be
   specified in one BGP message.  However, such multiple prefixes may
   have different path information.  Thus, to distinguish the sub-TLV
   for different prefixes, the order of the sub-TLVs MUST be in
   accordance with the prefix order encapsulated in the Update PDU.

3.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA assign the following new parameters
   to the BMP parameters name space.

   Type = TBD1 (2 Octets): indicates that it's the Path Information TLV.

4.  Security Considerations

   It is not believed that this document adds any additional security
   considerations.
