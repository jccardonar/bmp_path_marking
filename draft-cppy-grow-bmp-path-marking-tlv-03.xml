    <abstract>
      <t>The BGP Monitoring Protocol (BMP) provides an interface for obtaining
      BGP Path information. BGP Path Information is conveyed within BMP Route
      Monitoring (RM) messages. This document proposes an extension to BMP to
      convey the status of a BGP path after being processed by the BGP
      best-path selection algorithm. This extension makes use of the TLV
      mechanims described in <xref
      target="I-D.grow-bmp-tlv">draft-grow-bmp-tlv</xref>.</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>For a given prefix, multiple paths with different path status, e.g.,
      the "best-path", "back-up path" and so on, may co-exist in the BGP RIB
      after being processed by the local policy and the BGP decision process.
      The path status information is currently not carried in the BGP Update
      Message <xref target="RFC4271">RFC4271</xref> or in the BMP Update
      Message <xref target="RFC7854">RFC7854</xref>.</t>

      <t>External systems can use the path status for various applications.
      The path status is commonly checked by operators when performing
      troubleshooting. Having such status stored in a centralized system can
      enable the development of tools facilitating this process. Optimisation
      systems can include the path status in their process, and also use the
      status as a validation source (since it can compare the calculated state
      to the actual outcome of the network, such as primary and backup path).
      As a final example, path status information can complement other
      centralized sources of data, for example, flow collectors.</t>

      <t>This document defines a so-called Path Marking TLV to convey the BGP
      path status information to the BMP server. The BMP Path Marking is
      defined to be prepended in the BMP Route Monitoring (RM) Message.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Prefix Information TLV for the RM Message">
      <t>As per <xref target="RFC7854">RFC7854</xref>, the BMP RM Message
      consists of the Common Header, Per-Peer Header, and the BGP Update PDU.
      According to <xref target="I-D.grow-bmp-tlv">draft-grow-bmp-tlv</xref> ,
      optional trailing data in TLV format is allowed in the BMP RM Message to
      convey characteristics of transported NLRIs (i.e. to help stateless
      parsing) or vendor-specific data. Such TLV types are to be defined for
      each application.</t>

      <t>This document defines the Prefix Information TLV to convey
      descriptional information for route prefixes. The format is shown
      below.</t>

    <section title="Path Marking sub-TLV">
      <t>As stated in Appendix F.1 of <xref target="RFC4271">RFC4271</xref>,
      multiple address prefixes with the same path attributes are allowed to
      be specified in one message. However, such multiple prefixes may have
      different prefix information, e.g., path status. Thus, to indicate the
      path status for each BGP prefix, we define the Path Marking sub-TLV. The
      order of the Path Marking sub-TLVs MUST be in accordance with the prefix
      order of the Update PDU.</t>

      <t>The <xref target="I-D.lucente-grow-bmp-tlv-ebit">E-bit</xref>
      mechanism allows the usage of vendor-specific TLVs in addition to
      IANA-registered one. In this document, both encoding options for the
      Path Marking sub-TLV are described.</t>
